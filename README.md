# Simple classification neural net in c++
## Tests include MNIST Classification and XOR Classification

Very simple implementation, made in 3 days, of a classification neural network in C++.

All is coded from scratch, with flexible classes that can be built on to add more functionalities.

Not intented to be optimal, only for training purposes.
